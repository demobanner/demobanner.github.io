Dear Sul san, 

So sorry to bother you because we know that you are so busy but I think you should know the real situation currently happening in HR. 

- We really disappointed about the performance review result letter today. We received 2 emails but finally we did not know how much % salary increase or how much payrise. Why the funny letter can be approved to send out?

- Why this time we dont have increase in basic salary? Company are reduced 5% social insurance but why EVO dont increase our basic salary?

- We use the same review template as before but we all think that it was non sense as the result is unreasonable and our effort was not regconized with that payrise. We disapointed from the begining of the review when receiving not clear information for the review from HR.

- Do you know that many employees' salary were wrongly calculated? And this happen again and again every month until now?

- Do you know that when it was wrong we sent chat/email asking clarification but no reply or no explain?

- You always say that you care to eva colors but why our questions/ inquiry sent directly to HR Manager or HR Director but no reply?

- Do you know that even we did not receive any excuse for the mistake of wrong calculation. We dont care who calculate our salary FA or HR. Whoever, we received the payslip from HR Manager so we asked HR Manager but no reply? what is she doing?

- Do you know that when many employees' salary was wrong and waiting for HRM answer, we still saw she sitting at Library in 2nd floor of SFC eating, chatting, laughing asif nothing happen ? 

- When a lab member is not qualified for the post and could not complete assigned tasks we will be released out of the lab? So what if HR Manager or HR Director could not complete the role of manager and director? Are they released out of HR team to BO?

- When we ask HR members about employees' benefits like Health check up, company trip.... HR members could not answer us when. OK. It's understandable as they are staff level. But why Manager and Director level could not give proper answer ?

- Do you know that many HR issues have been taken long long time to get the answers.
Before, when we couldnot get an answer from HR members, we can raise the questions to Ms. Phuong Anh directly and she always give us prompt answer and solutions with respect. But now we really disapointed about the way HR treating us by " sorry we dont have information to inform you" Funny HR team.

- Do you know when we raise the issues to Lab manager, Lab manager answered us that HR has solved the problem. But actually no one from HR contact us to solve the problem. :(

- Do you know that when many employees' salary was wrong and waiting for HR Manager answer, we still saw her sitting at Library in 2nd floor of SFC eating, chatting, laughing as if nothing happen. 

Many employees feel now HR team is going down even they recruit many new members. We dont believe in HR anymore. We havent heard any word from HR Director - Mr. Tran Van Minh.  I heard that emails sent to him will never receive the reply. 
But sometimes we can see his funny chat on public chat group so we know ah he's there. he is alive and he still can speak Vietnamese.

Please save your time to review your HR team and the capability of HR Director- Mr. Minh and new HR Manager - Ms. Nguyen Thi Ai Hang. I personally think that a strong team must need a good director and a good manager. We havent seen HR Director action. We have seen some actions and many mistakes from HR Manager without excuse. We do know that they are new. But I personally think that at that level they need to be qualified enough to manage a team and especially when you want to reach 1000 employees we should have trust in HR or Lab manager or EVO management team. 

Finally we just want to share with you that now we really disappointed abt HR team in general and Im sorry for my long email, for my poor English. 

I do know that you are so busy with big plan but many employees dont know who to say to and I just want to gather their comments and complaints about HR currently even we know that our comments just for fun and nothing happen after all but at least you know the current situation. 

Thanks so much for your time reading my long email.

P/S:
My friends do know Ms. Hang - ex HR manager of GoGame - the company in Vietnam with 10 times less than EVO and we can get information abt her capability.  The only thing we dont understand is why as an HR Manager but she asks tea-lady to sell her yogurt at EVO cafeteria. We wonder if she has the right to do extra job at EVO by asking her staff to sell her yogurt to earn extra money at EVO.
